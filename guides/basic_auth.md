There are multiple ways to configure your credentials.

    provider "scc" {
        instance_url = <your_instance_url>
        username = <your_username>
        password = <your_password>
    }
    ```

2. You can export them as environment variables as shown below:

    #### Windows 

    If you use Windows CMD, do the export via the following commands:

    ```Shell
    set SCC_USERNAME=<your_username>
    set SCC_PASSWORD=<your_password>
    ```

    If you use Powershell, do the export via the following commands:

    ```Shell
    $Env:SCC_USERNAME = '<your_username>'
    $Env:SCC_PASSWORD = '<your_password>'
    ```

    #### Mac

    For Mac OS export the environment variables via:

    ```Shell
    export SCC_USERNAME=<your_username>
    export SCC_PASSWORD=<your_password>
    ```

    #### Linux
